BarCampKL Hub
=============

This is a 'hub' page for barcampers to hang out *during* the event. It combines both Mibbit IRC chat room and Twitter Search of the event's keyword. It polls for latest tweets which contain the keyword and also its current position in the trending topics. Pretty cool.

Feel free to fork this and rename anything to your city's BarCamp or BeerCamp or WhateverCamp. Have fun!
